# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1.Python
# 2.R
# 3.SQL

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1.Pandas
# 2.Scikit-learn
# 3.Matplotlib

# Data Science Tools
# 
# 1.Jupyter Notebook	 
# 2.RStudio	
# 3.Visual Studio Code

# Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
# 
# # Addition
# result_add = 5 + 3
# print(result_add)  # Output: 8
# 
# # Subtraction
# result_sub = 10 - 4
# print(result_sub)  # Output: 6
# 
# # Multiplication
# result_mul = 6 * 7
# print(result_mul)  # Output: 42
# 
# # Division
# result_div = 15 / 3
# print(result_div)  # Output: 5.0 (Note: In Python 3, division always returns a float)
# 
# # Integer Division (Floor Division)
# result_int_div = 15 // 4
# print(result_int_div)  # Output: 3 (Rounds down to the nearest whole number)

# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

# In[1]:


(3*4)+5


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60

# In[2]:


minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
